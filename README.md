# PiSite
The goal of this project is to have a working dashboard that is able to display on one device (i.e. a Raspberry Pi) and be configured on another device. This project has grown slightly beyond this original scope to turn it into a more "kitchen sink" style project, where several unrelated features continue to be piled on.

## Running the project
1. Install the latest versions of NodeJS, NPM, and the Angular CLI.
1. In the project directory, run `npm install`.
1. Edit `src/environments/environments.ts` and set the given values to what matches your API configuration. For information about setting up the API, visit https://github.com/cox5529/pi-site-api.
1. Run `ng serve`
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. The default login is configured on the API side.
